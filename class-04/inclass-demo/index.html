    <section id="bio">
      <p>I'm Audrey! I'm a Software Developer based in Seattle, WA. I'm experienced in JavaScript, React, React Native,
        and Node.js. I have over ten years of experience in software training and implementation. I love that technology
        is constantly changing because it allows me to keep my mind active as I continue to learn new things. I made the
        jump into software development by learning through free courses and then finally completing a six month coding
        bootcamp. If I can make a positive impact on the world through the projects I work on or create, then moving
        into this industry has been worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from software development, I enjoy spending time with my daughter and two chonky kitties. I love creating
        art, collecting art in the form of tattoos, and geeking out over the hottest celebrity gossip!</p>
