# Class 03 Lecture Notes

## Arrays

- Data Type - data structure (special type of object)
- A collection or a list of elements
  - Can be mixed.. strings, numbers, booleans, or other arrays in one single array
- In JS we don't predetermine the size of our array
- Every element in the Array has index or location reference.
- JS arrays are zero based index.

- Built in methods
  - `.pop()` - removes elements from the end of the array
  - `.push()` - add elements to the end of the array

- Property
  - .length - tell us how long our array

## Loops

### For Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - Great for doing something a certain number of times
  - Great for iterating or looping through arrays!

```javascript
for(starting value; condition; increment){
  do something for a finite number of times
}
```

### While Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - While loops do something until the condition is false
  - Beware of infinite loops!

```javascript
while(condition){
  do soemthing until the condition is false
}
```
